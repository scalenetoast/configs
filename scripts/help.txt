scripts for using the "nm-connection-editor" and the "nmcli con" to connect and openvpn connection

using the connection editor the configs should already be added and they should have the option where password
is remembered for all users.

a RANDOM vpn will always be chosen (becuz it's easier for me) 
can be changed to enter a number to choose that vpn if wanted

can set an optional alias in the .bashrc that runs both scripts
